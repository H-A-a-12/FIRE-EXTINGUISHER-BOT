                                             welcome 
In this project we built the bot which can be controlled by using the Wireless technology such as NodeMcu .
when the bot goes into the fire accident it gives the Live video which help to understand the situation  . It also gives the important data such as 
the humindity , temperature , pressure , Co2 level etc .  










thanks
